SHUT THE POPHOLES WITH THE RING OF LIGHT FROM HIS LANTERN DANCING FROM SIDE TO SIDE HE LURCHED ACROSS THE YARD KICKED OFF HIS BOOTS AT THE BACK DOOR DREW HIMSELF A LAST GLASS OF BEER FROM THE BARREL IN THE SCULLERY AND MADE HIS WAY UP TO BED WHERE MRS JONES WAS ALREADY SNORING AS SOON AS THE LIGHT IN THE BEDROOM WENT OUT THERE WAS A STIRRING AND A FLUTTERING ALL THROUGH THE FARM BUILDINGS WORD HAD GONE ROUND DURING THE DAY THAT OLD MAJOR THE PRIZE MIDDLE WHITE BOAR HAD HAD A STRANGE DREAM ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WISHED TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THE OTHER ANIMALS IT HAD BEEN AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL MEET IN THE BIG BARN AS SOON AS MR JONES WAS SAFELY OUT OF THE WAY OLD MAJOR SO HE WAS ALWAYS CALLED THOUGH THE NAME UNDER WHICH HE HAD BEEN EXHIBITED WAS WILLINGDON BEAUTY WAS SO HIGHLY REGARDED ON THE FARM THAT EVERYONE WAS QUITE READY TO LOSE AN HOURS SLEEP IN ORDER TO HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AT ONE END OF THE BIG BARN ON A SORT OF RAISED PLATFORM MAJOR WAS ALREADY ENSCONCED ON HIS BED OF STRAW UNDER A LANTERN WHICH HUNG FROM A BEAM HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD AND HAD LATELY GROWN RATHER STOUT BUT HE WAS STILL A MAJESTIC-LOOKING PIG WITH A WISE AND BENEVOLENT APPEARANCE IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HIS TUSHES HAD NEVER BEEN CUT BEFORE LONG THE OTHER ANIMALS BEGAN TO ARRIVE AND MAKE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE AFTER THEIR DIFFERENT FASHIONS FIRST CAME THE THREE DOGS BLUEBELL JESSIE AND PINCHER AND THEN THE PIGS WHO SETTLED DOWN IN THE STRAW IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE PLATFORM THE HENS PERCHED THEMSELVES ON THE WINDOW-SILLS THE PIGEONS FLUTTERED UP TO THE RAFTERS THE SHEEP AND COWS LAY DOWN BEHIND THE PIGS AND BEGAN TO CHEW THE CUD THE TWO CART-HORSES BOXER AND CLOVER CAME IN TOGETHER WALKING VERY SLOWLY AND SETTING DOWN THEIR VAST HAIRY HOOFS WITH GREAT CARE LEST THERE SHOULD BE SOME SMALL ANIMAL CONCEALED IN THE STRAW CLOVER WAS A STOUT MOTHERLY MARE APPROACHING MIDDLE LIFE WHO HAD NEVER QUITE GOT HER FIGURE BACK AFTER HER FOURTH FOAL BOXER WAS AN ENORMOUS BEAST NEARLY EIGHTEEN HANDS HIGH AND AS STRONG AS ANY TWO ORDINARY HORSES PUT TOGETHER A WHITE STRIPE DOWN HIS NOSE GAVE HIM A SOMEWHAT STUPID APPEARANCE AND IN FACT HE WAS NOT OF FIRST-RATE INTELLIGENCE BUT HE WAS UNIVERSALLY RESPECTED FOR HIS STEADINESS OF CHARACTER AND TREMENDOUS POWERS OF WORK AFTER THE HORSES CAME MURIEL THE WHITE GOAT AND BENJAMIN THE DONKEY BENJAMIN WAS THE OLDEST ANIMAL ON THE FARM AND THE WORST TEMPERED HE SELDOM TALKED AND WHEN HE DID IT WAS USUALLY TO MAKE SOME CYNICAL REMARK-FOR INSTANCE HE WOULD SAY THAT GOD HAD GIVEN HIM A TAIL TO KEEP THE FLIES OFF BUT THAT HE WOULD SOONER HAVE HAD NO TAIL AND NO FLIES ALONE AMONG THE ANIMALS ON THE FARM HE NEVER LAUGHED IF ASKED WHY HE WOULD SAY THAT HE SAW NOTHING TO LAUGH AT NEVERTHELESS WITHOUT OPENLY ADMITTING IT HE WAS DEVOTED TO BOXER THE TWO OF THEM USUALLY SPENT THEIR SUNDAYS TOGETHER IN THE SMALL PADDOCK BEYOND THE ORCHARD ANIMAL FARM 1 GRAZING SIDE BY SIDE AND NEVER SPEAKING THE TWO HORSES HAD JUST LAIN DOWN WHEN A BROOD OF DUCKLINGS WHICH HAD LOST THEIR MOTHER FILED INTO THE BARN CHEEPING FEEBLY AND WANDERING FROM SIDE TO SIDE TO FIND SOME PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD NOT BE TRODDEN ON CLOVER MADE A SORT OF WALL ROUND THEM WITH HER GREAT FORELEG AND THE DUCKLINGS NESTLED DOWN INSIDE IT AND PROMPTLY FELL ASLEEP AT THE LAST MOMENT MOLLIE THE FOOLISH PRETTY WHITE MARE WHO DREW MR JONESS TRAP CAME MINCING DAINTILY IN CHEWING AT A LUMP OF SUGAR SHE TOOK A PLACE NEAR THE FRONT AND BEGAN FLIRTING HER WHITE MANE HOPING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE RED RIBBONS IT WAS PLAITED WITH LAST OF ALL CAME THE CAT WHO LOOKED ROUND AS USUAL FOR THE WARMEST PLACE AND FINALLY SQUEEZED HERSELF IN BETWEEN BOXER AND CLOVER THERE SHE PURRED CONTENTEDLY THROUGHOUT MAJORS SPEECH WITHOUT LISTENING TO A WORD OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING ALL THE ANIMALS WERE NOW PRESENT EXCEPT MOSES THE TAME RAVEN WHO SLEPT ON A PERCH BEHIND THE BACK DOOR WHEN MAJOR SAW THAT THEY HAD ALL MADE THEMSELVES COMFORTABLE AND WERE WAITING ATTENTIVELY HE CLEARED HIS THROAT AND BEGAN COMRADES YOU HAVE HEARD ALREADY ABOUT THE STRANGE DREAM THAT I HAD LAST NIGHT BUT I WILL COME TO THE DREAM LATER I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO SAY FIRST I DO NOT THINK COMRADES THAT I SHALL BE WITH YOU FOR MANY MONTHS LONGER AND BEFORE I DIE I FEEL IT MY DUTY TO PASS ON TO YOU SUCH WISDOM AS I HAVE ACQUIRED I HAVE HAD A LONG LIFE I HAVE HAD MUCH TIME FOR THOUGHT AS I LAY ALONE IN MY STALL AND I THINK I MAY SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF LIFE ON THIS EARTH AS WELL AS ANY ANIMAL NOW LIVING IT IS ABOUT THIS THAT I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU NOW COMRADES WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THIS LIFE OF OURS LET US FACE IT OUR LIVES ARE MISERABLE LABORIOUS AND SHORT WE ARE BORN WE ARE GIVEN JUST SO MUCH FOOD AS WILL KEEP THE BREATH IN OUR BODIES AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE CAPABLE OF IT ARE FORCED TO WORK TO THE LAST ATOM OF OUR STRENGTH AND THE VERY INSTANT THAT OUR USEFULNESS HAS COME TO AN END WE ARE SLAUGHTERED WITH HIDEOUS CRUELTY NO ANIMAL IN ENGLAND KNOWS THE MEANING OF HAPPINESS OR LEISURE AFTER HE IS A YEAR OLD NO ANIMAL IN ENGLAND IS FREE THE LIFE OF AN ANIMAL IS MISERY AND SLAVERY THAT IS THE PLAIN TRUTH BUT IS THIS SIMPLY PART OF THE ORDER OF NATURE IS IT BECAUSE THIS LAND OF OURS IS SO POOR THAT IT CANNOT AFFORD A DECENT LIFE TO THOSE WHO DWELL UPON IT NO COMRADES A THOUSAND TIMES NO THE SOIL OF ENGLAND IS FERTILE ITS CLIMATE IS GOOD IT IS CAPABLE OF AFFORDING FOOD IN ABUNDANCE TO AN ENORMOUSLY GREATER NUMBER OF ANIMALS THAN NOW INHABIT IT THIS SINGLE FARM OF OURS WOULD SUPPORT A DOZEN HORSES TWENTY COWS HUNDREDS OF SHEEP-AND ALL OF THEM LIVING IN A COMFORT AND A DIGNITY THAT ARE NOW ALMOST BEYOND OUR IMAGINING WHY THEN DO WE CONTINUE IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION BECAUSE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE PRODUCE OF OUR LABOUR IS STOLEN FROM US BY HUMAN BEINGS THERE COMRADES IS THE ANSWER TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS IT IS SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE WORD-MAN MAN IS THE ONLY REAL ENEMY WE HAVE REMOVE MAN FROM THE SCENE AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF HUNGER AND OVERWORK IS ABOLISHED FOR EVER MAN IS THE ONLY CREATURE THAT CONSUMES WITHOUT PRODUCING HE DOES NOT GIVE MILK HE DOES NOT LAY EGGS HE IS TOO WEAK TO PULL THE PLOUGH HE CANNOT RUN FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH RABBITS YET HE IS LORD OF ALL THE ANIMALS HE SETS THEM TO WORK HE GIVES BACK TO THEM THE BARE MINIMUM THAT WILL PREVENT THEM FROM STARVING AND THE REST HE KEEPS FOR HIMSELF OUR LABOUR TILLS THE SOIL OUR DUNG FERTILISES IT AND YET THERE IS NOT ONE OF US THAT OWNS MORE THAN HIS BARE SKIN YOU COWS THAT I SEE BEFORE ME HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF MILK HAVE YOU GIVEN DURING THIS LAST YEAR AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THAT MILK WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN BREEDING UP STURDY CALVES EVERY DROP OF IT HAS GONE DOWN THE THROATS OF OUR ENEMIES AND YOU HENS HOW MANY EGGS HAVE YOU LAID IN THIS LAST YEAR AND HOW MANY

TWELVE YEARS OLD AND HAVE HAD OVER FOUR HUNDRED CHILDREN SUCH IS THE NATURAL LIFE OF A PIG BUT NO ANIMAL ESCAPES THE CRUEL KNIFE IN THE END YOU YOUNG PORKERS WHO ARE SITTING IN FRONT OF ME EVERY ONE

TIES A BRICK ROUND THEIR NECKS AND DROWNS THEM IN THE NEAREST POND IS IT NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR THEN COMRADES THAT ALL THE EVILS OF THIS LIFE OF OURS SPRING FROM THE TYRANNY OF HUMAN BEINGS ONLY GET RID OF MAN AND THE PRODUCE OF OUR LABOUR WOULD BE OUR OWN A1MOST OVERNIGHT WE COULD BECOME RICH AND FREE WHAT THEN MUST WE DO WHY WORK NIGHT AND DAY BODY AND SOUL FOR THE OVERTHROW OF THE HUMAN RACE THAT IS MY MESSAGE TO YOU COMRADES REBELLION I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THAT REBELLION WILL COME IT MIGHT BE IN A WEEK OR IN A HUNDRED YEARS BUT I KNOW AS SURELY AS I SEE THIS STRAW BENEATH MY FEET THAT SOONER OR LATER JUSTICE WILL BE DONE FIX YOUR EYES ON THAT COMRADES THROUGHOUT THE SHORT REMAINDER OF YOUR LIVES AND ABOVE ALL PASS ON THIS MESSAGE OF MINE TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER YOU SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS SHALL CARRY ON THE STRUGGLE UNTIL IT IS VICTORIOUS AND REMEMBER COMRADES YOUR RESOLUTION MUST NEVER FALTER NO ARGUMENT MUST LEAD YOU ASTRAY NEVER LISTEN WHEN THEY TELL YOU THAT MAN AND THE ANIMALS HAVE A COMMON INTEREST THAT THE PROSPERITY OF THE ONE IS THE PROSPERITY OF THE OTHERS IT IS ALL LIES MAN SERVES THE INTERESTS OF NO CREATURE EXCEPT HIMSELF AND AMONG US ANIMALS LET THERE BE PERFECT UNITY PERFECT COMRADESHIP IN THE STRUGGLE ALL MEN ARE ENEMIES ALL ANIMALS ARE COMRADES AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS UPROAR WHILE MAJOR WAS SPEAKING FOUR LARGE RATS HAD CREPT OUT OF THEIR HOLES AND WERE SITTING ON THEIR HINDQUARTERS LISTENING TO HIM THE DOGS HAD SUDDENLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THEM AND IT WAS ONLY BY A SWIFT DASH FOR THEIR HOLES THAT THE RATS SAVED THEIR LIVES MAJOR RAISED HIS TROTTER FOR SILENCE COMRADES HE SAID HERE IS A POINT THAT MUST BE SETTLED THE WILD CREATURES SUCH AS RATS AND RABBITS-ARE THEY OUR FRIENDS OR OUR ENEMIES LET US PUT IT TO THE VOTE I PROPOSE THIS QUESTION TO THE MEETING ARE RATS COMRADES THE VOTE WAS TAKEN AT ONCE AND IT WAS AGREED BY AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY THAT RATS WERE COMRADES THERE WERE ONLY FOUR DISSENTIENTS THE THREE DOGS AND THE CAT WHO WAS AFTERWARDS DISCOVERED TO HAVE VOTED ON BOTH SIDES MAJOR CONTINUED I HAVE LITTLE MORE TO SAY I MERELY REPEAT REMEMBER ALWAYS YOUR DUTY OF ENMITY TOWARDS MAN AND ALL HIS WAYS WHATEVER GOES UPON TWO LEGS IS AN ENEMY WHATEVER GOES UPON FOUR LEGS OR HAS WINGS IS A FRIEND AND REMEMBER ALSO THAT IN FIGHTING AGAINST MAN WE MUST NOT COME TO RESEMBLE HIM EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE CONQUERED HIM DO NOT ADOPT HIS VICES NO ANIMAL MUST EVER LIVE IN A HOUSE OR SLEEP IN A BED OR WEAR CLOTHES OR DRINK ALCOHOL OR SMOKE TOBACCO OR TOUCH MONEY OR ENGAGE IN TRADE ALL THE HABITS OF MAN ARE EVIL AND ABOVE ALL NO ANIMAL MUST EVER TYRANNISE OVER HIS OWN KIND WEAK OR STRONG CLEVER OR SIMPLE WE ARE ALL BROTHERS NO ANIMAL MUST EVER KILL ANY OTHER ANIMAL ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL AND NOW COMRADES I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY DREAM OF LAST NIGHT I CANNOT DESCRIBE THAT DREAM TO YOU IT WAS A DREAM OF THE EARTH AS IT WILL BE WHEN MAN HAS VANISHED BUT IT REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING THAT I HAD LONG FORGOTTEN MANY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS A LITTLE PIG MY MOTHER AND THE OTHER SOWS USED TO SING AN OLD SONG OF WHICH THEY KNEW ONLY THE TUNE AND THE FIRST THREE WORDS I HAD KNOWN THAT TUNE IN MY INFANCY BUT IT HAD LONG SINCE PASSED OUT OF MY MIND LAST NIGHT HOWEVER IT CAME BACK TO ME IN MY DREAM AND WHAT IS MORE THE WORDS OF THE SONG ALSO CAME BACK-WORDS I AM CERTAIN WHICH WERE SUNG BY THE ANIMALS OF LONG AGO AND HAVE ANIMAL FARM ANIMAL FARM 3 BEEN LOST TO MEMORY FOR GENERATIONS I WILL SING YOU THAT SONG NOW COMRADES I AM OLD AND MY VOICE IS HOARSE BUT WHEN I HAVE TAUGHT YOU THE TUNE YOU CAN SING IT BETTER FOR YOURSELVES IT IS CALLED BEASTS OF ENGLAND OLD MAJOR CLEARED HIS THROAT AND BEGAN TO SING AS HE HAD SAID HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE BUT HE SANG WELL ENOUGH AND IT WAS A STIRRING TUNE SOMETHING BETWEEN CLEMENTINE AND LA CUCARACHA THE WORDS RAN BEASTS OF ENGLAND BEASTS OF IRELAND BEASTS OF EVERY LAND AND CLIME HEARKEN TO MY JOYFUL TIDINGS OF THE GOLDEN FUTURE TIME SOON OR LATE THE DAY IS COMING TYRANT MAN SHALL BE OERTHROWN AND THE FRUITFUL FIELDS OF ENGLAND SHALL BE TROD BY BEASTS ALONE RINGS SHALL VANISH FROM OUR NOSES AND THE HARNESS FROM OUR BACK BIT AND SPUR SHALL RUST FOREVER CRUEL WHIPS NO MORE SHALL CRACK RICHES MORE THAN MIND CAN PICTURE WHEAT AND BARLEY OATS AND HAY CLOVER BEANS AND MANGEL-WURZELS SHALL BE OURS UPON THAT DAY BRIGHT WILL SHINE THE FIELDS OF ENGLAND PURER SHALL ITS WATERS BE SWEETER YET SHALL BLOW ITS BREEZES ON THE DAY THAT SETS US FREE FOR THAT DAY WE ALL MUST LABOUR THOUGH WE DIE BEFORE IT BREAK ANIMAL FARM ANIMAL FARM 4 COWS AND HORSES GEESE AND TURKEYS ALL MUST TOIL FOR FREEDOMS SAKE BEASTS OF ENGLAND BEASTS OF IRELAND BEASTS OF EVERY LAND AND CLIME HEARKEN WELL AND SPREAD MY TIDINGS OF THE GOLDEN FUTURE TIME THE SINGING OF THIS SONG THREW THE ANIMALS INTO THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT ALMOST BEFORE MAJOR HAD REACHED THE END THEY HAD BEGUN SINGING IT FOR THEMSELVES EVEN THE STUPIDEST OF THEM HAD ALREADY PICKED UP THE TUNE AND A FEW OF THE WORDS AND AS FOR THE CLEVER ONES SUCH AS THE PIGS AND DOGS THEY HAD THE ENTIRE SONG BY HEART WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AND THEN AFTER A FEW PRELIMINARY TRIES THE WHOLE FARM BURST OUT INTO BEASTS OF ENGLAND IN TREMENDOUS UNISON THE COWS LOWED IT THE DOGS WHINED IT THE SHEEP BLEATED IT THE HORSES WHINNIED IT THE DUCKS QUACKED IT THEY WERE SO DELIGHTED WITH THE SONG THAT THEY SANG IT RIGHT THROUGH FIVE TIMES IN SUCCESSION AND MIGHT HAVE CONTINUED SINGING IT ALL NIGHT IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED UNFORTUNATELY THE UPROAR AWOKE MR JONES WHO SPRANG OUT OF BED MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS A FOX IN THE YARD HE SEIZED THE GUN WHICH ALWAYS STOOD IN A CORNER OF HIS BEDROOM AND LET FLY A CHARGE OF NUMBER 6 SHOT INTO THE DARKNESS THE PELLETS BURIED THEMSELVES IN THE WALL OF THE BARN AND THE MEETING BROKE UP HURRIEDLY EVERYONE FLED TO HIS OWN SLEEPING-PLACE THE BIRDS JUMPED ON TO THEIR PERCHES THE ANIMALS SETTLED DOWN IN THE STRAW AND THE WHOLE FARM WAS ASLEEP IN A MOMENT II THREE NIGHTS LATER OLD MAJOR DIED PEACEFULLY IN HIS SLEEP HIS BODY WAS BURIED AT THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD THIS WAS EARLY IN MARCH DURING THE NEXT THREE MONTHS THERE WAS MUCH SECRET ACTIVITY MAJORS SPEECH HAD GIVEN TO THE MORE INTELLIGENT ANIMALS ON THE FARM A COMPLETELY NEW OUTLOOK ON LIFE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHEN THE REBELLION PREDICTED BY MAJOR WOULD TAKE PLACE THEY HAD NO REASON FOR THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE WITHIN THEIR OWN LIFETIME BUT THEY SAW CLEARLY THAT IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO PREPARE FOR IT THE WORK OF TEACHING AND ORGANISING THE OTHERS FELL NATURALLY UPON THE PIGS WHO WERE GENERALLY RECOGNISED AS BEING THE CLEVEREST OF THE ANIMALS PRE-EMINENT AMONG THE PIGS WERE TWO YOUNG BOARS NAMED SNOWBALL AND NAPOLEON WHOM MR JONES WAS BREEDING UP FOR SALE NAPOLEON WAS A LARGE RATHER FIERCE-LOOKING BERKSHIRE BOAR THE ONLY BERKSHIRE ON THE FARM NOT MUCH OF A TALKER BUT WITH A REPUTATION FOR GETTING HIS OWN WAY SNOWBALL WAS A MORE VIVACIOUS PIG THAN NAPOLEON QUICKER IN SPEECH AND MORE INVENTIVE BUT WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO HAVE THE SAME DEPTH OF CHARACTER ALL THE OTHER MALE PIGS ON THE FARM WERE PORKERS THE BEST KNOWN AMONG THEM WAS A SMALL FAT PIG NAMED SQUEALER WITH VERY ROUND CHEEKS TWINKLING EYES NIMBLE MOVEMENTS AND A SHRILL VOICE HE WAS A BRILLIANT TALKER AND WHEN HE WAS ARGUING SOME DIFFICULT POINT HE HAD A WAY OF SKIPPING FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND WHISKING HIS TAIL WHICH WAS SOMEHOW VERY PERSUASIVE THE OTHERS SAID OF SQUEALER THAT HE COULD TURN BLACK INTO WHITE THESE THREE HAD ELABORATED OLD MAJORS TEACHINGS INTO A COMPLETE SYSTEM OF THOUGHT TO WHICH THEY GAVE THE NAME OF ANIMALISM SEVERAL NIGHTS A WEEK AFTER MR JONES WAS ASLEEP THEY HELD SECRET MEETINGS IN THE BARN AND EXPOUNDED THE PRINCIPLES OF ANIMALISM TO THE OTHERS AT THE BEGINNING THEY MET WITH MUCH STUPIDITY AND APATHY SOME OF THE ANIMALS TALKED OF THE DUTY OF LOYALTY TO MR JONES WHOM THEY REFERRED TO AS MASTER OR MADE ELEMENTARY REMARKS SUCH AS MR JONES FEEDS US IF HE WERE GONE WE SHOULD STARVE TO DEATH OTHERS ANIMAL FARM II 5 ASKED SUCH QUESTIONS AS WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE ARE DEAD OR IF THIS REBELLION IS TO HAPPEN ANYWAY WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHETHER WE WORK FOR IT OR NOT AND THE PIGS HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN MAKING THEM SEE THAT THIS WAS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF ANIMALISM THE STUPIDEST QUESTIONS OF ALL WERE ASKED BY MOLLIE THE WHITE MARE THE VERY FIRST QUESTION SHE ASKED SNOWBALL WAS WILL THERE STILL BE SUGAR AFTER THE REBELLION NO SAID SNOWBALL FIRMLY WE HAVE NO MEANS OF MAKING SUGAR ON THIS FARM BESIDES YOU DO NOT NEED SUGAR YOU WILL HAVE ALL THE OATS AND HAY YOU WANT AND SHALL I STILL BE ALLOWED TO WEAR RIBBONS IN MY MANE ASKED MOLLIE COMRADE SAID SNOWBALL THOSE RIBBONS THAT YOU ARE SO DEVOTED TO ARE THE BADGE OF SLAVERY CAN YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THAT LIBERTY IS WORTH MORE THAN RIBBONS MOLLIE AGREED BUT SHE DID NOT SOUND VERY CONVINCED THE PIGS HAD AN EVEN HARDER STRUGGLE TO COUNTERACT THE LIES PUT ABOUT BY MOSES THE TAME RAVEN MOSES WHO WAS MR JONESS ESPECIAL PET WAS A SPY AND A TALE-BEARER BUT HE WAS ALSO A CLEVER TALKER HE CLAIMED TO KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF A MYSTERIOUS COUNTRY CALLED SUGARCANDY MOUNTAIN TO WHICH ALL ANIMALS WENT WHEN THEY DIED IT WAS SITUATED SOMEWHERE UP IN THE SKY A LITTLE DISTANCE BEYOND THE CLOUDS MOSES SAID IN SUGARCANDY MOUNTAIN IT WAS SUNDAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK CLOVER WAS IN SEASON ALL THE YEAR ROUND AND LUMP SUGAR AND LINSEED CAKE GREW ON THE HEDGES THE ANIMALS HATED MOSES BECAUSE HE TOLD TALES AND DID NO WORK BUT SOME OF THEM BELIEVED IN SUGARCANDY MOUNTAIN AND THE PIGS HAD TO ARGUE VERY HARD TO PERSUADE THEM THAT THERE WAS NO SUCH PLACE THEIR MOST FAITHFUL DISCIPLES WERE THE TWO CART-HORSES BOXER AND CLOVER THESE TWO HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THINKING ANYTHING OUT FOR THEMSELVES BUT HAVING ONCE ACCEPTED THE PIGS AS THEIR TEACHERS THEY ABSORBED EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE TOLD AND PASSED IT ON TO THE OTHER ANIMALS BY SIMPLE ARGUMENTS THEY WERE UNFAILING IN THEIR ATTENDANCE AT THE SECRET MEETINGS IN THE BARN AND LED THE SINGING OF BEASTS OF ENGLAND WITH WHICH THE MEETINGS ALWAYS ENDED NOW AS IT TURNED OUT THE REBELLION WAS ACHIEVED MUCH EARLIER AND MORE EASILY THAN ANYONE HAD EXPECTED IN PAST YEARS MR JONES ALTHOUGH A HARD MASTER HAD BEEN A CAPABLE FARMER BUT OF LATE HE HAD FALLEN ON EVIL DAYS HE HAD BECOME MUCH DISHEARTENED AFTER LOSING MONEY IN A LAWSUIT AND HAD TAKEN TO DRINKING MORE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM FOR WHOLE DAYS AT A TIME HE WOULD LOUNGE IN HIS WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE KITCHEN READING THE NEWSPAPERS DRINKING AND OCCASIONALLY FEEDING MOSES ON CRUSTS OF BREAD SOAKED IN BEER HIS MEN WERE IDLE AND DISHONEST THE FIELDS WERE FULL OF WEEDS THE BUILDINGS WANTED ROOFING THE HEDGES WERE NEGLECTED AND THE ANIMALS WERE UNDERFED JUNE CAME AND THE HAY WAS ALMOST READY FOR CUTTING ON MIDSUMMERS EVE WHICH WAS A SATURDAY MR JONES WENT INTO WILLINGDON AND GOT SO DRUNK AT THE RED LION THAT HE DID NOT COME BACK TILL MIDDAY ON SUNDAY THE MEN HAD MILKED THE COWS IN THE EARLY MORNING AND THEN HAD GONE OUT RABBITING WITHOUT BOTHERING TO FEED THE ANIMALS WHEN MR JONES GOT BACK HE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO SLEEP ON THE DRAWING-ROOM SOFA WITH THE NEWS OF THE WORLD OVER HIS FACE SO THAT WHEN EVENING CAME THE ANIMALS WERE STILL UNFED AT LAST THEY COULD STAND IT NO LONGER ONE OF THE COWS BROKE IN THE DOOR OF THE STORE-SHED WITH HER HORN AND ALL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO HELP THEMSELVES FROM THE BINS IT WAS JUST THEN THAT MR JONES WOKE UP THE NEXT MOMENT HE AND HIS FOUR MEN WERE IN THE STORE-SHED WITH WHIPS IN THEIR HANDS LASHING OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS THIS WAS MORE THAN THE HUNGRY ANIMALS COULD BEAR WITH ONE ACCORD THOUGH NOTHING OF THE KIND HAD BEEN PLANNED BEFOREHAND THEY FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON THEIR TORMENTORS JONES AND HIS MEN SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES BEING BUTTED AND KICKED FROM ALL SIDES THE SITUATION WAS QUITE OUT OF THEIR CONTROL THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANIMALS BEHAVE LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THIS SUDDEN UPRISING OF CREATURES WHOM THEY WERE USED TO THRASHING AND MALTREATING JUST AS THEY ANIMAL FARM II 6 CHOSE FRIGHTENED THEM ALMOST OUT OF THEIR WITS AFTER ONLY A MOMENT OR TWO THEY GAVE UP TRYING TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND TOOK TO THEIR HEELS A MINUTE LATER ALL FIVE OF THEM WERE IN FULL FLIGHT DOWN THE CART-TRACK THAT LED TO THE MAIN ROAD WITH THE ANIMALS PURSUING THEM IN TRIUMPH MRS JONES LOOKED OUT OF THE BEDROOM WINDOW SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING HURRIEDLY FLUNG A FEW POSSESSIONS INTO A CARPET BAG AND SLIPPED OUT OF THE FARM BY ANOTHER WAY MOSES SPRANG OFF HIS PERCH AND FLAPPED AFTER HER CROAKING LOUDLY MEANWHILE THE ANIMALS HAD CHASED JONES AND HIS MEN OUT ON TO THE ROAD AND SLAMMED THE FIVE-BARRED GATE BEHIND THEM AND SO ALMOST BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE REBELLION HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED THROUGH JONES WAS EXPELLED AND THE MANOR FARM WAS THEIRS FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES THE ANIMALS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE IN THEIR GOOD FORTUNE THEIR FIRST ACT WAS TO GALLOP IN A BODY RIGHT ROUND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FARM AS THOUGH TO MAKE QUITE SURE THAT NO HUMAN BEING WAS HIDING ANYWHERE UPON IT THEN THEY RACED BACK TO THE FARM BUILDINGS TO WIPE OUT THE LAST TRACES OF JONESS HATED REIGN THE HARNESS-ROOM AT THE END OF THE STABLES WAS BROKEN OPEN THE BITS THE NOSE-RINGS THE DOG-CHAINS THE CRUEL KNIVES WITH WHICH MR JONES HAD BEEN USED TO CASTRATE THE PIGS AND LAMBS WERE ALL FLUNG DOWN THE WELL THE REINS THE HALTERS THE BLINKERS THE DEGRADING NOSEBAGS WERE THROWN ON TO THE RUBBISH FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE YARD SO WERE THE WHIPS ALL THE ANIMALS CAPERED WITH JOY WHEN THEY SAW THE WHIPS GOING UP IN FLAMES SNOWBALL ALSO THREW ON TO THE FIRE THE RIBBONS WITH WHICH THE HORSES MANES AND TAILS HAD USUALLY BEEN DECORATED ON MARKET DAYS RIBBONS HE SAID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS CLOTHES WHICH ARE THE MARK OF A HUMAN BEING ALL ANIMALS SHOULD GO NAKED WHEN BOXER HEARD THIS HE FETCHED THE SMALL STRAW HAT WHICH HE WORE IN SUMMER TO KEEP THE FLIES OUT OF HIS EARS AND FLUNG IT ON TO THE FIRE WITH THE REST IN A VERY LITTLE WHILE THE ANIMALS HAD DESTROYED EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED THEM OF MR JONES NAPOLEON THEN LED THEM BACK TO THE STORE-SHED AND SERVED OUT A DOUBLE RATION OF CORN TO EVERYBODY WITH TWO BISCUITS FOR EACH DOG THEN THEY SANG BEASTS OF ENGLAND FROM END TO END SEVEN TIMES RUNNING AND AFTER THAT THEY SETTLED DOWN FOR THE NIGHT AND SLEPT AS THEY HAD NEVER SLEPT BEFORE BUT THEY WOKE AT DAWN AS USUAL AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THE GLORIOUS THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THEY ALL RACED OUT INTO THE PASTURE TOGETHER A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE PASTURE THERE WAS A KNOLL THAT COMMANDED A VIEW OF MOST OF THE FARM THE ANIMALS RUSHED TO THE TOP OF IT AND GAZED ROUND THEM IN THE CLEAR MORNING LIGHT YES IT WAS THEIRS-EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD SEE WAS THEIRS IN THE ECSTASY OF THAT THOUGHT THEY GAMBOLLED ROUND AND ROUND THEY HURLED THEMSELVES INTO THE AIR IN GREAT LEAPS OF EXCITEMENT THEY ROLLED IN THE DEW THEY CROPPED MOUTHFULS OF THE SWEET SUMMER GRASS THEY KICKED UP CLODS OF THE BLACK EARTH AND SNUFFED ITS RICH SCENT THEN THEY MADE A TOUR OF INSPECTION OF THE WHOLE FARM AND SURVEYED WITH SPEECHLESS ADMIRATION THE PLOUGHLAND THE HAYFIELD THE ORCHARD THE POOL THE SPINNEY IT WAS AS THOUGH THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THESE THINGS BEFORE AND EVEN NOW THEY COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ALL THEIR OWN THEN THEY FILED BACK TO THE FARM BUILDINGS AND HALTED IN SILENCE OUTSIDE THE DOOR OF THE FARMHOUSE THAT WAS THEIRS TOO BUT THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO GO INSIDE AFTER A MOMENT HOWEVER SNOWBALL AND NAPOLEON BUTTED THE DOOR OPEN WITH THEIR SHOULDERS AND THE ANIMALS ENTERED IN SINGLE FILE WALKING WITH THE UTMOST CARE FOR FEAR OF DISTURBING ANYTHING THEY TIPTOED FROM ROOM TO ROOM AFRAID TO SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER AND GAZING WITH A KIND OF AWE AT THE UNBELIEVABLE LUXURY AT THE BEDS WITH THEIR FEATHER MATTRESSES THE LOOKING-GLASSES THE HORSEHAIR SOFA THE BRUSSELS CARPET THE LITHOGRAPH OF QUEEN VICTORIA OVER THE DRAWING-ROOM MANTELPIECE THEY WERE LUST COMING DOWN THE STAIRS WHEN MOLLIE WAS DISCOVERED TO BE MISSING GOING BACK THE OTHERS FOUND THAT SHE HAD REMAINED BEHIND IN THE BEST BEDROOM SHE HAD TAKEN A PIECE OF BLUE RIBBON FROM MRS JONESS DRESSING-TABLE AND WAS HOLDING IT AGAINST HER SHOULDER AND ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE GLASS IN A VERY FOOLISH MANNER THE OTHERS REPROACHED HER SHARPLY AND THEY WENT OUTSIDE SOME HAMS HANGING IN THE KITCHEN ANIMAL FARM II 7 WERE TAKEN OUT FOR BURIAL AND THE BARREL OF BEER IN THE SCULLERY WAS STOVE IN WITH A KICK FROM BOXERS HOOF-OTHERWISE NOTHING IN THE HOUSE WAS TOUCHED A UNANIMOUS RESOLUTION WAS PASSED ON THE SPOT THAT THE FARMHOUSE SHOULD BE PRESERVED AS A MUSEUM ALL WERE AGREED THAT NO ANIMAL MUST EVER LIVE THERE THE ANIMALS HAD THEIR BREAKFAST AND THEN SNOWBALL AND NAPOLEON CALLED THEM TOGETHER AGAIN COMRADES SAID SNOWBALL IT IS HALF-PAST SIX AND WE HAVE A LONG DAY BEFORE US TODAY WE BEGIN THE HAY HARVEST BUT THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO FIRST THE PIGS NOW REVEALED THAT DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS THEY HAD TAUGHT THEMSELVES TO READ AND WRITE FROM AN OLD SPELLING BOOK WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MR JONESS CHILDREN AND WHICH HAD BEEN THROWN ON THE RUBBISH HEAP NAPOLEON SENT FOR POTS OF BLACK AND WHITE PAINT AND LED THE WAY DOWN TO THE FIVE-BARRED GATE THAT GAVE ON TO THE MAIN ROAD THEN SNOWBALL FOR IT WAS SNOWBALL WHO WAS BEST AT WRITING TOOK A BRUSH BETWEEN THE TWO KNUCKLES OF HIS TROTTER PAINTED OUT MANOR FARM FROM THE TOP BAR OF THE GATE AND IN ITS PLACE PAINTED ANIMAL FARM THIS WAS TO BE THE NAME OF THE FARM FROM NOW ONWARDS AFTER THIS THEY WENT BACK TO THE FARM BUILDINGS WHERE SNOWBALL AND NAPOLEON SENT FOR A LADDER WHICH THEY CAUSED TO BE SET AGAINST THE END WALL OF THE BIG BARN THEY EXPLAINED THAT BY THEIR STUDIES OF THE PAST THREE MONTHS THE PIGS HAD SUCCEEDED IN REDUCING THE PRINCIPLES OF ANIMALISM TO SEVEN COMMANDMENTS THESE SEVEN COMMANDMENTS WOULD NOW BE INSCRIBED ON THE WALL THEY WOULD FORM AN UNALTERABLE LAW BY WHICH ALL THE ANIMALS ON ANIMAL FARM MUST LIVE FOR EVER AFTER WITH SOME DIFFICULTY FOR IT IS NOT EASY FOR A PIG TO BALANCE HIMSELF ON A LADDER SNOWBALL CLIMBED UP AND SET TO WORK WITH SQUEALER A FEW RUNGS BELOW HIM HOLDING THE PAINT-POT THE COMMANDMENTS WERE WRITTEN ON THE TARRED WALL IN GREAT WHITE LETTERS THAT COULD BE READ THIRTY YARDS AWAY THEY RAN THUS
